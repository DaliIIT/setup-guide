# Signal-Guide
On this repository, you will find guides about Signal Setup that might help people who want to run their own signal server.

## Content
What's proven works
* Signal Server
* Signal Android
* Signal Desktop
* Coturn Server
* Nginx Server
* Twilio
* Amazon Web Service (AWS)

What's not proven work
* Contact Discovery Service (CDS), you still can setup your server without CDS.

At the moment, I don't have Apple Developer license, so I won't be able to help anything regarding Signal iOS.

## FAQ
Q: Will I be able to do ... with Signal?

A: My suggestion is first you need to setup normal signal server and check if it will fulfill your need.
